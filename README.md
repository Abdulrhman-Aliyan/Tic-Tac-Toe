### Acknowledgments 🙏

I developed this Tic-Tac-Toe game with the invaluable knowledge gained from the [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course on Udemy, taught by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. This comprehensive course provided a solid foundation in React development, state management with Redux, and advanced React concepts, which were instrumental in building this project.


### Learning Reflection 🌱

Building this Tic-Tac-Toe game was an exciting application of the skills and techniques learned throughout the course. Concepts such as component composition, state management, and functional components with hooks greatly influenced the architecture of this project. I'm grateful for the clear explanations and hands-on exercises that enabled me to create interactive React applications confidently.
